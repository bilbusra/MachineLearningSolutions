My Codes for Some Machine Learning Problems

Hi,

I share some of my works (unfortunately I cannot share most of them due to the companies' policy) to help understand 
Feature Extraction, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. For RecSys Solutions, I was very Junior (the first time I started to learn 
Data Science) and the files can be messed up, but if you are interested, I can reorganize them.

In Speech Emotion, I used MFCC & Mel Spectrogram Features. If my conference papers are accepted, I will add the other features with Audio Processing.
